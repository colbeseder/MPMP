Here is my code for solving Matt Parker's Maths Puzzles

I didn't attempt all of the puzzles. And not all the puzzles I solved were done with code.
But the ones that were, I dumped the code here without much cleaning.

## Season 1 result

Final position: **147th**

Highest position: **68th** (after puzzle 17)

## Summary

I had fun.
