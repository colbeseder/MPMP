# MPMP

Here is code to solve a subset of Matt Parker's Maths Puzzles

Most are in Python, but some were solved using _Rust_, _Golang_, _JavaScipt_ and _Excel_. 

Most of the code is rough and ready, with a priority of submitting the answer early.

## What was your season 1 result?

Final position: **147th** out of 16,892 (top percentile)

Highest position: **68th** (after puzzle 17)

## Where are all of the other solutions?

Some I missed.
Others, I did on paper.

## Summary

Thanks to Matt Parker for all the puzzles. I had fun.
